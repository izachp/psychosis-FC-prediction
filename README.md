Code for manuscript preprint 'Functional coupling and longitudinal outcome prediction in first-episode psychosis' [ADD medrxiv link]

This work uses multiple cross-validated prediction algorithms to evaluate whether resting-state functional coupling (FC), acquired via fMRI, could predict the longitudinal changes in symptoms and functioning of first-episode psychosis patients in the STAGES clinical trial. *Short answer: it could not.*

This repository includes:
- Code for fMRI preprocessing and creation of FC matrices
- Code for the three prediction algorithms used
- Code for assessing prediction performance & significance and generating results figures
