Data and code for submitted manuscript 'Functional coupling and longitudinal outcome prediction in first-episode psychosis'

This work uses multiple cross-validated prediction algorithms to evaluate whether resting-state functional coupling (FC), acquired via fMRI, could predict the longitudinal changes in symptoms and functioning of first-episode psychosis patients in the STAGES clinical trial. *Short answer: it could not.*

**This repository includes:**
- Clinical outcome data
- Preprocessed and parcellated fMRI timeseries
- Code for creating FC matrices
- Code for running the three prediction algorithms
- Code for assessing prediction performance & significance and generating results figures

**NOTE:** Since the STAGES dataset used here is not open-access, we are unable to provide raw MRI data for patients. The clinical outcome data has also been z-scored, which may minimally affect any results generated.
